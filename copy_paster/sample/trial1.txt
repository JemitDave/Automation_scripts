Obtain a tridiagonal matrix (suitable for numerical solution) for a wire of L=10-m length.
Use N=6 knots (ix=6) and the running index from 1 to 6. There are 6 temperatures [T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6] and the x-vector [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6]. This problem is developed with indices starting in one to match the indexes in the development of Thomas Algorithm.
The step size and discretization:
